Configuration module for Simple CamIO.

This module contains all configuration parameters and constants used throughout the application.
Centralizing configuration makes it easier to tune parameters and understand system behavior.

PERFORMANCE TUNING:
- For best FPS: Set DEFAULT_WIDTH=640, DEFAULT_HEIGHT=480, USE_THREADED_CAPTURE=True
- For quality: Set DEFAULT_WIDTH=1920, DEFAULT_HEIGHT=1080, but expect lower FPS
- If camera is slow: Enable USE_THREADED_CAPTURE and try BACKEND=cv.CAP_MSMF

    This configuration supports adaptive tap detection that scales thresholds based on

    2. Angle-based analysis (finger flexion at DIP joint)
    3. Enhanced analysis (palm plane penetration, relative depth, ray projection)
